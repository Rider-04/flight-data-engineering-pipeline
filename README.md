## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **data engineering pipeline** for processing and analyzing large-scale flight data. The focus is on transforming raw, high-volume data into an optimized dataset suitable for business intelligence and visualization.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```text
MySQL Database → Spoon (ETL) → MySQL (Transformation) → SQL Views → Power BI
```

---

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Extraction

* Data sourced from a MySQL database with restricted export access
* Small tables extracted manually
* Large dataset ingested directly using Spoon (Pentaho Data Integration)

---

### 🔹 2. Data Cleaning (Spoon)

* Removed **50–60 unnecessary columns**
* Selected only relevant fields:

  * Flight Date
  * Airline
  * Origin & Destination
  * Delay metrics
* Structured dataset for analytical use

---

### 🔹 3. Data Transformation (MySQL)

* Initial dataset: ~445,000 rows
* Applied aggregation to optimize performance
* Final dataset: **6,324 rows**

```sql
GROUP BY year, month, uniquecarrier, origin, dest
```

---

### 🔹 4. Data Modeling

* Created dimension tables:

  * `dim_airline`
  * `dim_airport`
  * `dim_month`
  * `dim_date`
* Designed a **star-schema-like structure**

---

### 🔹 5. Analytical Layer (SQL Views)

* Created reusable SQL views:

  * Aggregated metrics
  * Joined descriptive attributes
* Final reporting view:

  * `vw_flight_analysis`

---

### 🔹 6. Visualization (Power BI)

* Built interactive dashboards focusing on:

  * Airline performance
  * Route analysis
  * Delay breakdown

## 🔐 Data Access Note

The dataset was accessed from an external MySQL database with restricted permissions.
Credentials and direct access details are not included for security reasons.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

* Handling large datasets under system constraints
* Designing efficient ETL pipelines
* Optimizing data for BI tools
* Building reusable analytical views
* Creating business-focused dashboards from raw data

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Automate pipeline scheduling
* Implement incremental data loading
* Migrate pipeline to cloud platforms (AWS / Azure)
* Add predictive analytics for delay forecasting
